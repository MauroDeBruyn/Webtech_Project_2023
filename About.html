  Hello there!<br>
  <br>
  We welcome you into our site!<br>
  We are a group of 3 students of the PXL,<br>
  and we were instructed to make a website for the web technology course.<br>
  Our website has 4 pages, one is a home page that greeds you to our site.<br>
  The second is this "about" page, which will tell you about the project.<br>
  The third page contains information about us, the students whom created this site.<br>
  And the last page, will show you live feed uploaded by a FPGA to our site.<br>
  The live feed contains the temperature of the processor on the FPGA.<br>
  As an example of what it could show.<br>
  <br>
  This was our introduction and have fun on our site!<br>
